This helps understand the effects of track width and wheelbase by plotting the Milliken Diagram (Yaw-Moment)
This uses the methods found in "Vehicle agile maneuvering: From rally drivers to a finite state machine approach" by Acosta, M, Kanarachos, S & Blundell, M

Instructions: Run main_MMD.m to get a Milliken Moment Diagram (MMD). You can change vehicle paramters in the vehicle_params.m.

Please note that Track_and_Wheelbase.m, solve_point.m, and build_diamond.m aren't used in main_MMD.m and are old code.
