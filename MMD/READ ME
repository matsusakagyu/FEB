This helps understand the effects of vehicle paramters through the Milliken Moment Diagram (Yaw-Moment).

Credit: This uses the methods found in "Vehicle agile maneuvering: From rally drivers to a finite state machine approach" by Acosta, M, Kanarachos, S & Blundell, M. Chat GPT helped with some of my code lol

Instructions: Run main_MMD.m to get a Milliken Moment Diagram (MMD). You can change vehicle paramters in the vehicle_params.m. You can also run overlay_MMD_sweep.m to sweep through wheelbase and track ratios to plot the envelope. You can simply call overlay_MMD_sweep(rhoL_vec, rhoT_vec) to sweep through both values. rhoL_vec and rhoT_vec is a 1xn vector of sweept values. If you want to fix track or wheel base, just input a singular number.

How to Interprte: 

Please note that Track_and_Wheelbase.m, solve_point.m, run_MMD_sweep.m, and build_diamond.m aren't used in main_MMD.m and are old code.
